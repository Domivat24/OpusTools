    "LMDesc_LM_SportsStadium": "\"The 21st Hetmis Games\" ...What was this? The sign is covered in scribbles.",
    "LMDesc_LM_SulphurElectric": "So this is where our factory used to get the chips... to think that they always traveled this far for these...",
    "LMDesc_LM_ChurchHoly": "Our oldest church. This is where I became a witch, and slept for 20 years.",
    "LMDesc_LM_LaunchSiteHoly": "Before the snow, this place was covered in black stone. I even helped carved some of the names here.",
